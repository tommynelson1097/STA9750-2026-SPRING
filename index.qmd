# About Me

I’m an **Analytics Engineer** with a background in business intelligence and data engineering, currently pursuing my MS in Business Analytics & Information Systems. I specialize in building **scalable data models for product analytics**, transforming complex telemetry and event data into reliable, well-structured datasets that empower product teams to make data-informed decisions.

My work sits at the intersection of data engineering and analytics—designing clean, performant data models that support experimentation, product insights, and self-service reporting at scale.

I’m passionate about bridging the gap between technical data infrastructure and business strategy—whether that’s architecting telemetry pipelines, optimizing data transformations, or enabling product teams with trustworthy metrics.

## What You’ll Find Here (Future)

- Projects in product analytics and telemetry modeling
